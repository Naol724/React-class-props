# React Class Components & Props – Mini Project

This project is a small React application built using **Vite**.  
It demonstrates the fundamentals of **Class-Based Components**, **Props**, and **Component Reusability** in React.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This mini-project helps you understand:

- How to create **Class Components** in React  
- How to pass **props** from parent to child components  
- How to organize components in a clean folder structure  
- How to style components using an external CSS file  
- How to render multiple components dynamically  

The project is simple, clean, and beginner-friendly — perfect for learning the basics of React (before Hooks).
